\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5}{\ignorespaces A figure from the paper~\cite  {Happel2023} showing a phase field variable $\phi $ on a curved domain, specifically a torus. In (a) and (b), the surface of the torus from (c) is shown as a parametrization on a rectangle, where the blue edges are identified (glued together) to form the toroidal direction, and the red edges are similarly identified to form the poloidal direction. Red and blue lines represent periodic boundary conditions, which are enforced by gluing the corresponding edges in (b) and (c). The color coding corresponds to the extrinsic curvature parameter $E_c$ (see Eq.~(3)): $E_c = 0$ (purple) results in a geodesic circle on both geometries; $E_c > 0$ (green) favors alignment with the direction of maximum absolute curvature; $E_c < 0$ (yellow) favors alignment with the direction of minimal absolute curvature. Cell elongation is highlighted for visibility. On toroidal surfaces, cell shape depends on position due to varying curvature. (c) shows the trajectories, final positions, and shapes of cells over time.
