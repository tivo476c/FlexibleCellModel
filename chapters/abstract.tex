\section*{Abstract}

Building upon the foundations laid in the Bachelor's thesis~\cite{Vogel2023}, significant improvements were made, including bug fixes, code parallelisation, and reformulation of forces for stable large-scale simulations (detailed in Sections~\ref{model} and~\ref{dynamics}). \\
Chapter~\ref{sanitycheck} presents a rigorous validation by recreating the diffusion dynamics of the point particle and hard sphere models from~\cite{Bruna2012} through extensive Monte Carlo simulations with varying hardness ($h \in \{0, 0.5, 1\}$), representing soft, intermediate, and hard cell behaviours. \\
Subsequently, Chapter~\ref{density} analyses the resulting density dynamics. 
By connecting to the frameworks of~\cite{Bruna2012, Bruna2017, Boromand2018}, this work provides a unified perspective on cell dynamics spanning rigid to deformable regimes. 
Finally, the thesis concludes with a summary of findings and an outlook on potential future extensions and applications of the DF model.
