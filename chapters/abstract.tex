\section*{Abstract}

Building upon the foundations laid in the Bachelor's thesis~\cite{Vogel2023}, significant improvements were made, including bug fixes, code parallelisation, and reformulation of forces for stable large scale simulations (detailed in Sections~\ref{model} and~\ref{dynamics}). \\
Chapter~\ref{sanitycheck} presents a rigorous validation by recreating the diffusion dynamics of the point particle and hard sphere models from~\cite{Bruna2012} through extensive Monte Carlo simulations with varying hardness ($h \in \{0, 0.5, 1\}$), representing soft, intermediate, and hard cell behaviours. 
The chapter further investigates shape deformation and highlights the dependence of cell diffusion and deformation on hardness and initial packing. \\
Subsequently, Chapter~\ref{density} derives the macroscopic mean field description of the DF model. 
Starting from the vertex wise stochastic dynamics, partial differential equations governing the evolution of the mean field density are obtained, including explicit forms for shape preserving energies. 
A low-dimensional example illustrates the correspondence between first marginals of the empirical measure and the mean field limit, providing a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions. \\
By connecting to the frameworks of~\cite{Bruna2012, Bruna2017, Boromand2018}, this work provides a unified perspective on cell dynamics spanning rigid to deformable regimes. 
Finally, the thesis concludes with a summary of findings and an outlook on potential future extensions and applications of the DF model.
