\section{Outlook}

An interesting extension of the current model would involve assigning individual desired states to each cell, in contrast to the uniform desired state used throughout this study. 
This modification would naturally lead to cell-specific energies and corresponding forces, as both would depend on the unique desired configuration of each cell. 
Incorporating such heterogeneity could allow the model to capture more complex biological behaviors, such as differentiation, cell-type-specific migration, or adaptive responses to environmental cues.
