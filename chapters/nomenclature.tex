\midrule
ODE & An ordinary differential equation, using derivatives with respect to a single independent variable. \\
PDE & A partial differential equation is an equation that contains unknown multivariable functions and their partial derivatives. \\
SDE & A stochastic differential equation is a differential equation in which one or more of the terms is a stochastic process, resulting in a solution that is also a stochastic process. \\
HSCM & Hard sphere cell model introduced in~\cite{Bruna2012}, often used as a reference cell model \\
DF model & The discrete form model is a vertex cell model that is defined by a list of all wall points. \\
Shape preserving forces & Area, edge and interior angle force from the DF model \\
Interaction forces & shape deforming overlap and bounce overlap force from the DF model \\
i.i.d. & independent and identically distributed \\
