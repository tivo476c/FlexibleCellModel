\section{TODOs}

\textbf{Cell dynamics - SDE}
\begin{itemize}
    \item add SDE for vertices
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item finish markus corrections in hard & soft sphere model: 
    \item state that the new domain produces extra boundary terms in the transition to the first marginal function, 
    \item write a bit more in soft sphere model: what about joined density, which methods are used for deriving firs marginal, compare to first marginal of hard spheres,
    \item also green notes from printed intro. 
    \item edit phasefield figure: make axis description smaller, add cross section figure
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sanity Check}
\begin{itemize}
    \item write down the results 
    \item analyse them -> is there much to say? we only see a faster diffusion for harder cells 
    \item start a new sim with needles? stability issues, how solve them? 
    \item add those aquator diagrams 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Density comps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item think about density pde. Remember edge computation with edge energy and 2 vertices cells (photo!)
    \item read robins BT, learn how this works 
    \item the shape preserving forces dont change density 
    \item What to do with overlap forces?  
    \item write everything down      
\end{itemize}

\textbf{general things}
\begin{itemize}
    \item add left(, right) where it is necessary 
    \item control indices 
    \item check - 
    \item add references to introduction papers to all chapters
    \item be consistent in naming of DF model 
    \item do a spell check to only use UK english
    \item check punctation and spaces in equations
    \item also use arrows for multidimensional functions? T.T
\end{itemize}
