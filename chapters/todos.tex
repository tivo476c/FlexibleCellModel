\section{TODOs}

\textbf{Abstract}
\begin{itemize}
    \item add what was done in the end 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{df model dynamics }
\begin{itemize}
    \item explain what the k does to the forces (k=1 -> discrepance between current and desired state does not influence scaling of force, k=2 -> it does influence it linearly)
    \item explain that we use k=1 only for deforming overlap and k=2 for shape preserving forces 
    \item explain that each figure representing a force has every parameter chosen to be equivalent to the big monte carlo simulations in the next chapter: cell size, desired states (perfect 6eck with distance 0.005 from each vertex to the cell centre), force scalings, time step size  
    \item explain that we tried to use unfavourable initital states to test the forces stability 
    \item change some of the 1e2 type numbers (eg 1e-1 -> 0.1)
    \item write down the cell SDE nicely 
    \item check this force and the computations in the proof, especially the neighboring vertices part 
    \item add an example figure with 2 DF cells having two overlaps and write down what $\Omega_{1,2}$ is and what their overlaps are
    \item change from $A_D^k$ to $(A_D)^k$ in proof of deforming overlap force
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Density comps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item write in sentences
    \item check the signs in needle sim and mean field pde
    \item think about mean field pde with interaction
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item summarise all results from the thesis 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Outlook}
\begin{itemize}
    \item gather input
    \item structurise 
    \item add bridges to chapters 
    \item formulate in sentences 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{general things}
\begin{itemize}
    \item control indices 
    \item add references to introduction papers to all chapters
    \item do a spell check to only use UK english
    \item insert correct gif links
\end{itemize}
