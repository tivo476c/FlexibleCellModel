\section{Cell model} 
* introduce the Discrete cell form (DCF) \\
- can i just reference my bachelor thesis or how should i do that? 

\subsection{Discrete cell form}
* the discrete cell form consists of a list that holds all wall points in consecutive order 

\subsection{Cell dynamics} 
* area force \\
* edge force \\
* interior angle force \\ 
* overlap force \\

\subsection{Numerical solver}
* DifferentialEquations.jl solver 
* solve(prob_cell1, EM(), dt=timeStepSize)
* -> Euler Maruyama method with fixed time step size
