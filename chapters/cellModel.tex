\section{Cell model} 
* introduce the Discrete cell form (DCF) 
    -> can i just reference my bachelor thesis or how should i do that? 

\subsection{Discrete cell form}
* the discrete cell form consists of a list that holds all wall points in consecutive order 

\subsection{Cell dynamics} 
* area force 
* edge force 
* interior angle force 
* overlap force
