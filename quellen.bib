  abstract = {A system of interacting Brownian particles subject to short-range repulsive potentials is considered. A continuum description in the form of a nonlinear diffusion equation is derived systematically in the dilute limit using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. Numerical simulations are performed to compare the results of the model with those of the commonly used mean-field and Kirkwood-superposition approximations, as well as with Monte Carlo simulation of the stochastic particle system, for various interaction potentials. Our approach works best for very repulsive short-range potentials, while the mean-field approximation is suitable for long-range interactions. The Kirkwood-superposition approximation provides an accurate description for both short- and long-range potentials but is considerably more computationally intensive.},

  abstract = {The dynamic behavior of epithelial cell sheets plays a central role during numerous developmental processes. Genetic and imaging studies of epithelial morphogenesis in a wide range of organisms have led to increasingly detailed mechanisms of cell sheet dynamics. Computational models offer a useful means by which to investigate and test these mechanisms, and have played a key role in the study of cell-cell interactions. A variety of modeling approaches can be used to simulate the balance of forces within an epithelial sheet. Vertex models are a class of such models that consider cells as individual objects, approximated by two-dimensional polygons representing cellular interfaces, in which each vertex moves in response to forces due to growth, interfacial tension, and pressure within each cell. Vertex models are used to study cellular processes within epithelia, including cell motility, adhesion, mitosis, and delamination. This review summarizes how vertex models have been used to provide insight into developmental processes and highlights current challenges in this area, including progressing these models from two to three dimensions and developing new tools for model validation.},
